4.	 Design and User Experience.

I used the default font of html. I have a light blue background. I used bullet lists on some of the pages. I centred all the pages and everything on most of the pages which would make it easier for the reader to read. I used different font sizes for words and   captions and also made certain words like the captions and questions bold. 
5.	 Technical Requirements.

I will be using HTML for programming language and frameworks. HTML, which is Hyper Text Markup Language is basically a language used to create a web page. It is spine or the main framework that makes a web page functions. HTML will define the structure, add content, provides links and enable styling. HTML has basic HTML concepts like elements, tags, attributes and values.
